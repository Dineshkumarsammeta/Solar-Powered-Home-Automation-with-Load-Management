# Solar-Powered Home Automation with Load Management

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **solar-powered home automation system** that controls lights, fans, and small appliances based on the availability of solar energy. It uses **Arduino** (or Raspberry Pi), relays, and sensors to automatically manage loads, prioritize essential devices, and ensure efficient use of renewable energy.  

---

## Features
- **Solar Power Integration:** Loads are powered primarily by solar energy.  
- **Automatic Load Management:** Prioritizes essential appliances when solar power is limited.  
- **Relay-Based Switching:** Automatic on/off switching of devices based on sensor readings.  
- **Manual Override:** Users can manually control devices if needed.  
- **Affordable & Easy:** Uses widely available components for practical implementation.
